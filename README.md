# Text Prompt Generator for README Files

This project provides a powerful tool to create high-quality README files for GitHub repositories using generative text tools like ChatGPT. The main goal of this tool is to help those who building new resources like prompts and scripts generate comprehensive and informative READMEs for their projects, streamlining the process and ensuring a consistent style and format.

## Overview

Given a code repository and a text prompt, the Text Prompt Generator for README Files utilizes generative text tools like ChatGPT to produce a README file that is tailored to the specific needs and structure of the project. The generated READMEs follow a clean and organized format, making it easy for users to understand the project and its components.

This project is designed to work seamlessly with generative text tools, leveraging their capabilities to create engaging and informative README files for a wide variety of code repositories.

## Example Usage

To generate a README file for your project, follow these steps:
1. Use a generative text tool like ChatGPT to create a text prompt asking it to write a README file for your code repository. Be sure to include relevant details and any specific requirements for the README format. For example:

```
Please write a README file for Github for this: [code/prompt]
```

2. The generative text tool will generate a comprehensive and well-structured README file based on your prompt. Review and edit the generated README as needed.

3. Save the README file in your GitHub repository to provide users with a clear and informative guide for your project.

NOTE: When creating a README for a prompt, consider using an adapted prompt. Since README's are traditionally written for software, the tool may assume that is what you are attempting to provide it. Here is an adapted prompt to create README's for prompts:


```
Please write a README file for Github for this prompt: [prompt]

This README is to help users use the prompt provided above with generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This is NOT code or a script.
```
## Disclaimer

The quality of the generated README files depends on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the provided text prompt, as well as the capabilities of the generative text tool used. Always review and edit the generated README files to ensure they meet your project's requirements and provide accurate information to users.
